%
% disp_gr.m		Displays the graph og reachable markings
% evolgr.m		Calculation of matrix of evolution graph for continuous Petri nets with constant speed
% getnum.m		Convert numerical part of string to number
% getpnt.m		Find out type of transmission
% graph.m		Finds adjancency matrix A an matrix reachable markings B
% graphpri.m		Finds a graph of reachable markings to given marked bounded Priority Petri Net
% ind.m			Gets indexes of rows and columns
% playstpn.m		Token player for T-timed PNs and stochastic PNs, single firing semantic
% playstpnex.m		Token player for T-timed PNs and stochastic PNs, single firing semantic, list of state in each time
% rdp.m			Reads matrix Pre, Post, initial marking from graphical editor PMEdit
% rdp2stpn.m		Reads matrix Pre, Post, initial marking, type of transition, times of timed transition
%			from graphical editor PMEdit ( input parameters for playstpn)
% rdp2pri.m		Reads matrix Pre, Post, initial marking, type of transition, times of timed transition
%			and priority of transition from graphical editor PMEdit (input parameters for graphpri)
%			This function must be also used when we want to read parameters of continuous Petri net, 
%			where parameter PrioT is equivalent to V (vector maximal speed in CPN)
% silva.m		Gets P-invariants of PNs
